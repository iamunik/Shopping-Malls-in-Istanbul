### ⚒️ Tools Used

- **Power BI** (Data modeling, DAX, and visualization)



### 🎯 Objectives

- Build a stakeholder-friendly dashboard for monitoring **retail performance** across malls.
- Practice **data storytelling** by extracting insights on:
  - Product category performance
  - Mall-wise revenue contribution
  - Customer demographics and payment behavior
  - Seasonal and yearly revenue trends

## 🧠 Data Exploration Insight

While the dashboards and insights are structured to reflect a real-world retail environment, **an important finding emerged during data exploration**:

> 🔍 **The dataset was artificially generated.**

### Why This Matters:

During early EDA (exploratory data analysis), there were **unnaturally uniform distributions** across:
- Age groups  
- Cost and price values  
- Customer segments

This uniformity is uncommon in real transactional data and pointed to the use of functions like `.random.choice()` during dataset generation.
